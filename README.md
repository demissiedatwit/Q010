# Question - Think about why might you need " .bind " for the second one and not the first? Explain. (Hint: Grid, Pane, and GridPane)
# Answer - The '.bind' method is used in the second example to keep the circle centered within the pane, automatically adjusting its position when the pane's size changes. The first example with a GridPane doesn't require binding because it uses a static grid layout where components are automatically positioned. Binding is essential for dynamic layouts that need to respond to changes in the user interface.
